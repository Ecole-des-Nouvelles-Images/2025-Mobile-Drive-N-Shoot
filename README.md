  <h1>Gameplay</h1>
</div>

**Drive'N'Shoot** is a **racing game** where the player must pass through **checkpoints** before time runs out while **shooting** at enemies trying to destroy us.

The player controls a pickup truck equipped with a turret. A **timer** starts at the beginning of the game, and the goal is to reach the next **checkpoint** before it runs out. At each checkpoint, time is added to the timer.  
To do this, the player must move around and **dodge** or **kill** enemies who are trying to slow them down and **destroy them** using the turret.  
Along the way, the player can collect **items** by taking an “alternative” route, which they can use whenever they want.

If the timer reaches **zero** or the vehicle is **destroyed**, the **game is over**.

## Items
There are **3 different items**, each with its own effect :

</div>

## Game mechanics
The player can **move**, **shoot**, use an **item**, and **boost** by shaking the device.
